# @whereq/react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d7d51be: Add `Avatar` and `AvatarGroup` components.

  `Avatar` is a generic, accessible avatar chip: it renders an image and gracefully
  falls back to name-derived initials (on a deterministic colour) or a custom node
  when the image is missing or fails to load. It supports `circle` / `rounded` /
  `square` shapes, an inset `ring`, a presence `status` dot, and head-cropping of
  portraits via `position="top"`. `AvatarGroup` overlaps avatars with a `+N`
  overflow chip. The initials/colour helpers (`initialsFromName`, `colorFromName`)
  are exported too. SSR-safe with no stylesheet injection.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release. `Scrollbar` and `GlobalScrollbar` — whereq.cc's thin, themeable,
  accessible native scrollbar as reusable React components. Ships ESM + CJS + types
  with a `"use client"` boundary for Next.js App Router.
